# Domain Events

- Domain events are facts
- published by aggregates
- using a messaging mechanism to publish the domain event to interested parties or subscribing to bounded context
- When it comes to names, use past tense and follow with a noun. For instance, ProductCreated, UserCreated, etc.
- Provide the exact same properties that trigger the domain event. This captures the fact that the cause had an effect and there is now a fact according to those properties.
- Store the domain event and the changes in the aggregate with the same transaction, then they will be committed or rolled back together.
