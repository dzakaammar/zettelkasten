# Thinking In Systems by Donella H. Meadows (Chapter 1)

## Summary
To be able to "think in systems", we need to understand what the system is and how the system works.


## Notes
The system consists of three kinds of things:
1. Elements
	- Parts that build a system as a whole. Think about a football team, then the elements are the player, the coach, and the referee. 
2. Interconnections
	- The relationship that holds the elements together. The system's behavior and how the system works to achieve its goals. If it is a football team, then interconnections will be the communication of the players, strategy, etc.
3. Function or purpose
	- The best way to deduce the system's purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.
	- Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals
	- If it is a football team, then the purpose will be to win a match.
	- The purpose of subunits may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants. For instance, the football team's purpose is to win a game. But if some players cheat and have another purpose from the main purpose, then all the system's (football team) purpose will be affected.
	- Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is essential for successful systems.

A system generally goes on being itself, even with complete substitutions of its elements -- as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact. For instance, we may change the football players, but if we still keep the strategy and the purpose, it will be considered the same team. **Unless changing an element also results in changing relationships or purposes**. For instance, changing one leader at the top level or president.

A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time.

Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow. Inflow and outflow. 


> System thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanism for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.

People monitor stocks constantly and make decisions and take actions designed to raise or lower stocks or to keep them within acceptable ranges.

To control the stocks and keep them available or in the acceptable range, we need to monitor and control them with the **feedback loop**.
