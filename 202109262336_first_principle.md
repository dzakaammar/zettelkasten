# First Principle
> A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone

> ... for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements -- Aristotle

Adalah sebuah prinsip untuk menggali *knowledge* atau permasalahan hingga ke akarnya atau ke dasar ide. Dengan begitu kita dapat mereduksi semua asumsi yang dibuat.

> The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If the cook lost the recipe, he'd be screwed. The chef, on the other hand, understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn't even use a recipe.
