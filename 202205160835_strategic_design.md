# Strategic Design

Bounded Context
- a contextual or semantic boundary
- everything is explicit within the model
- everything has a specific meaning
- the bounded context will be interpreted as a specific service
- think of the bounded context also as dividing nuance of meaning or different words for the same thing
- helps us to model what is in context and out of context
- there are always multiple bounded contexts

> Hexagonal Architecture

Ubiquitous Language
- you can trace the business scenario within the software model
- it's not within the entire organization, instead, this is within a single application
- the model within a specific service
- ubiquitous language is coupled with the bounded context and has specific meaning throughout that boundary
- it will have a different meaning when it is spoken in a different context of boundary

> Think bounded context and ubiquitous language as a language in each different country. French will be spoken in France, Spanish in Spain, and Italian in Italy. Each country (bounded context) will have a different language (ubiquitous language). Even in a country where they have the same language, some words will have a different meanings.
